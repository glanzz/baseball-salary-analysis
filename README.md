Author: Bhargav Nanjundappa

This repository contains all the resources for Exploratory Data Analysis of Baseball team performance between 1986 and 1987 using [Baseball Salary Data](https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/baseball.data).
We ask the following meaningful questions:
- Can we predict the salaries of players from their performance metrics ?
We analyze the data using multi regression model to identify which performance metrics like batting average, runs, etc. explain the salaries of players. The model can help any players determine if they are fairly compensated and evaluate their performance credibility.
- What impact does external factors (team, league, season) have on player performance ?
We identify what external features could be a contributor to player performance metric This gives insights of factors to further identify if team coaching for a particular team or resourceful team have better players.
